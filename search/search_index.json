The methods covered include the Euler method, second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2), and fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4). Euler Method The Euler method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ODEs. It is the simplest Runge-Kutta method. Second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2) The RK2 method is a second-order method, providing better accuracy than the Euler method. Fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) The RK4 method is one of the most widely used methods for solving ODEs due to its balance between simplicity and accuracy.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction-to-numerical-methods-for-odes","text":"This documentation provides an overview of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using Python.
