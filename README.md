# ode_documentation
This repository is created as a homework assignment for the Computational Physics course.

It contains the implementation and documentation of three numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs): the `Euler` method, the second-order `Runge-Kutta` method (RK2), and the fourth-order `Runge-Kutta` method (RK4).

The documentation is generated using MkDocs and hosted on GitHub Pages. It includes:

- An introduction to the numerical methods used, including relevant equations.
- Detailed documentation of the `euler`, `rk2`, and `rk4` functions, including usage examples and expected input/output.

The purpose of this project is to practice version control with Git and the creation of reference documents using MkDocs.
