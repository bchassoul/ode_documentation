# Introduction to Numerical Methods for ODEs

This documentation provides an overview of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using Python. The methods covered include the Euler method, second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2), and fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4).

## Euler Method
The Euler method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ODEs. It is the simplest Runge-Kutta method.

## Second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2)
The RK2 method is a second-order method, providing better accuracy than the Euler method.

## Fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4)
The RK4 method is one of the most widely used methods for solving ODEs due to its balance between simplicity and accuracy.
