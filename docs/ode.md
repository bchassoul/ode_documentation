# ODE Module

This section contains the documentation for the functions in the `ode` module.

## Euler
The Euler method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ODEs. It is the simplest Runge-Kutta method.
```python
{% include "../ode/euler.py" %}
```
## Second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2)
The RK2 method is a second-order method, providing better accuracy than the Euler method.
```python
{% include "../ode/rk2.py" %}
```
## Fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4)
The RK4 method is one of the most widely used methods for solving ODEs due to its balance between simplicity and accuracy.
```python
{% include "../ode/rk4.py" %}
```
